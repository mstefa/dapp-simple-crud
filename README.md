# SIMPLE DAPP CRUD

This proyect is build with the aim to learn how to create a complete dapp including a solidity smart contract, a complete set of test for this contract and a front-end page to interact with it. 

My goal is to continue developing this proyect for practicing this thechnologies.

For now, copy the abi and contract addres to data.json on client/src since its not trivial conect files outside src folder on creat-react-app proyects
